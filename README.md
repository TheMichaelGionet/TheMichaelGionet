- Hi, I’m Michael Gionet (TheMichaelGionet)
- My interests hover between mathematics, computer engineering, and neuroscience.
- I’m currently learning Complex Analysis and neuroscience in my (scarce) free time. 
- I am currently in my 3A term at the University of Waterloo for Computer Engineering.
- The purpose of this github is to post my personal projects. The last one I've made available is a RISC-V virtual machine.
