- Hi, I’m Michael Gionet (TheMichaelGionet)
- The purpose of this github is to post my personal and research projects. The last one I've made available is a RISC-V virtual machine.
  
- I am currently in my 4B term at the University of Waterloo for Computer Engineering.
- My academic interests hover between mathematics and computer engineering.
- More precisely, I have learned real, fourier, and complex analysis from Tao's and Stein's books on analysis. Then Number Theory and Analytic Number Theory from Underwood Dudley and Apostol's books.
- I specialized in the hardware/embedded/dsp area during my undergrad.
- Best courses I have taken are ones on simulating neurobiological systems, where you get to simulate how brains work, and computer architecture, where you get to build a RISC-V core.
- During my last coop term, I did a research internship where I implemented Fully Homomorphic Encryption in hardware.

- My current intentions are to go to grad school within the next few years to do something relating to hardware. 

- When I get more time after university, I will probably use this github to create and share more projects.
